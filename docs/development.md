I want to make a bot which is capable of analyzing a non-mainstream stock which gained a significant amount of market cap, then (somewhat nebulously) figure out if it will fail or not. If it expects it to fail, I want the bot to enter a short position and sell once a certain percentage of profit has been reached. Otherwise, the bot should leave the stock alone. I will probably program it to see if something is falling first and short if it is falling first.
