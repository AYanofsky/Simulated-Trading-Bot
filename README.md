# DO NOT USE THIS BOT AS FINANCIAL ADVICE. HOOKING IT UP TO A TRADING API IS *NOT* A GOOD IDEA. THIS BOT IS A PERSONAL PROJECT. 
## An algorithmic, short-term trading bot.
This project will be written in Python.
Due to this project's nature I will likely not be deploying it to an environment where it has access to actual funds. It is intended to be used for educational purposes (subject to change) in a controlled, simulated environment.

I used @rreichel3's list of tickers to test this thing with a large data set. You can find it [here](https://github.com/rreichel3/US-Stock-Symbols).

Currently, this bot is capable of detecting breakouts and suggesting take-profit and stop-loss orders.

See strategy-change branch for current theory and architecture.
